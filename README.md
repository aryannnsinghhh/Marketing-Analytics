## Getting Started - Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **SQL Server** (Express or Developer Edition)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** - Optional but recommended
- **Power BI Desktop** - For dashboard visualization

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataAnalystPortfolioProject_PBI_SQL_Python_MarketingAnalytics.git
cd DataAnalystPortfolioProject_PBI_SQL_Python_MarketingAnalytics
```

### Step 2: Database Setup
1. **Restore Database from Backup:**
   ```sql
   -- In SSMS or sqlcmd, restore the database
   RESTORE DATABASE MarketingAnalytics 
   FROM DISK = 'C:\path\to\your\project\MarketingAnalytics.bak'
   WITH REPLACE
   ```
   
2. **Get Your SQL Server Instance Name:**
   - Open SSMS and note your server name (e.g., `localhost`, `COMPUTERNAME\SQLEXPRESS`)
   - Or run in Command Prompt: `sqlcmd -L` to list available instances

### Step 3: Python Environment Setup
1. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas nltk pyodbc sqlalchemy
   ```

2. **IMPORTANT: Configure Database Connection**
   
   **Before running the Python script, you MUST update the configuration:**
   
   Open `customer_reviews_enrichment.py` and update the CONFIG section:
   ```python
   CONFIG = {
       'server': 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SERVER_NAME',  # ← REPLACE THIS!
       'database': 'MarketingAnalytics',      # ← Keep as-is after restore
       'output_file': 'fact_customer_reviews_enrich.csv'
   }
   ```
   
   **Examples of server names:**
   - `'localhost'` - if using default instance
   - `'DESKTOP-ABC123'` - your computer name
   - `'COMPUTERNAME\\SQLEXPRESS'` - if using SQL Server Express
   
   **To find your server name:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Get computer name
   hostname
   
   # Option 2: Test SQL Server connection
   sqlcmd -S localhost -E -Q "SELECT @@SERVERNAME"
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Analysis
```bash
python customer_reviews_enrichment.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Database connection confirmation
- Sentiment analysis progress
- Generated file: `fact_customer_reviews_enrich.csv`

### Step 5: Power BI Setup
1. Open `Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop
2. **Update Data Source Connection:**
   - Go to Transform Data → Data Source Settings
   - Update server name to match your SQL Server instance
   - Refresh the data

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
1. **"SQL Server does not exist or access denied"**
   - Wrong server name in CONFIG
   - Update `'server'` value in `customer_reviews_enrichment.py`

2. **"Database 'MarketingAnalytics' does not exist"**
   - Database not restored properly
   - Check database restoration step

3. **Python package errors**
   - Missing dependencies
   - Run: `pip install pandas nltk pyodbc sqlalchemy`

#### Quick Test:
```bash
# Test database connection
sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER_NAME -E -d MarketingAnalytics -Q "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_reviews"
```
